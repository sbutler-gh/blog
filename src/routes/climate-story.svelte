<p>I'm working on a story about climate #migration, mixing cultures, and convivial transitions &mdash; in the face of an #extraction culture, and challenges to survive.</p>

<p>Do you know any folks who could be interested in imagining and working on these worlds together?</p>

<p>The story may feature characters and communities from sacrifice zones. #Indigenous coastal peoples, #island nations, those dying from drought and famine in #Kenya and #Africa.</p>

<p>I'm looking for collaborators who can represent and uphold these cultures + communities in the story.</p>

<p>It also gets into housing and land rights, #lowtech convivial transitions, #postgrowth worlds, and #landback in the USA.</p>
