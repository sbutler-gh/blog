    <div class="e-content">
        <p>I presume you've read the news.</p>

        <p>By and large, most carbon offsets to date — even the best of them — <a href="https://carbon-direct.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CD-Commentary-on-Voluntary-Registry-Offsets-Database_April-2021.pdf">are basically bullshit. <img src="" style="display: none;"/></a></p>

        <p>And yet, because we have not yet gathered the social muster to force a more prudent and sane course of action to avoid environmental collapse (like, the decisionmakers at polluting firms deciding to ... stop polluting), it appears politicians and industry chiefs and great leaders around the world are set on a new messiah, a new boss: carbon offset regimes.</p>
        
        <p>At this point, we must answer a pivotal question, which should guide all our future thought and actions.</p>
        
        <h4>What are we trying to do?</h4>
        
        <p>When you say "climate", or I say "sustainability", what are we trying to do?</p>
        
        <p>For me, I'd sum it up as:</p>
        
        <strong>Avoid environmental collapse, and improve social outcomes.</strong>
        
        <p>This begs a second question:</p>
            
            <strong>Why is the environment collapsing?</strong>
        
        <p>In short, because our ways of life are too burdensome on the environment.</p>
        
        <p>Ex: If our environment had a greater carrying capacity, or our ways of life were less burdensome, the environment would not be collapsing.</p>
        
            <p>... But right now, it is.</p>
        
        <!-- <p>To avoid environmental collapse, we must shift to ways of life that are <em>less burdensome</em> on the environment (reduce / reuse / repair / recycle),  and which <em>increase the carrying capacity</em> of the environment (regenerate), while improving social outcomes.</p>
        
        <p>Burdens include activities like overharvesting, polluting, and mining.  Increasing carrying capacity include reforestation, regenerative agriculture, rewilding, re-everything.</p> -->
        
        <p>And one of the biggest burdens on the environment is carbon in the atmosphere.</p>
        
        <p>How?</p>
        
        <p>1. Excessive absorption of CO2 is killing ocean life (by reducing PH levels and making the water acidic).</p>
        
        <p>2. Excessive GHG in the atmosphere is reducing insect fertility, driving species extinction, destabilizing weather patterns, increasing rates of natural disasters, and simultaneously creating flood and drought risks (by heating the atmosphere at a rate of 4 nuclear bombs per second, h/t <a href="https://continuations.com/post/187534394205/climate-crisis">Albert Wenger</a>), along with diminishing global food productivity.</p>
        
        <p>Better yet, these consequences are happening faster and faster every day.</p>
        
        <p>The more heat trapped in the atmosphere → the more heat trapped in the atmosphere → the more heat trapped in the atmosphere.  (Maybe we'll get some luck with increasing heat causing increasing cloudcover and albedo reflection.  Don't count on it.)</p>
        
        <p>To slow down this rollercoaster of a not-so-idyllic future, and remove this existential burden from our environment, we need to permanently decrease the amount of carbon and GHGs that are in the atmosphere.</p>
        
        <p>How much?</p>
        
        <p>Enough to maintain a maximum of ~350 parts per million CO2.</p>
            
        <p>We were last at 350 ppm <a href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/">in 1987</a>, so that means we need to remove all of the carbon put into the atmosphere over the last 34 years, and all of the new of the carbon we emit while we clean up the mess behind us.</p>
        
        <p>So when it's all said and done, we'll have removed 64 years of carbon emitted during the peak oil period of human civilization.</p>
        
        <!-- <p>If we had 5 rings and were in a Marvel movie, maybe we could do this in a snap.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, this will be much more difficult here in our universe.</p> -->

        <p><em>(pause)</em></p>
        
        <p>On the bright side, our environment is capable of permanently removing carbon from the atmosphere.  Also, human inventions are becoming more and more capable of permanently removing carbon from the atmosphere.</p>
        
        <p>So, if we just (a) stop putting carbon into the atmosphere in the first place, (b) increase the Earth's capacity to remove carbon, and (c) rapidly iterate + evolve our human techniques for removing carbon from the atmosphere, we have a plan that is as good as we can muster. (See <a href="https://globalecoguy.org/we-need-4-waves-of-climate-solutions-6e58adbc5ad6">4 Waves of Climate Action</a> by Dr. Jonathan Foley)</p>
        
        <p>And then, we just have to move as fast as concievably possible on removing those 64 years worth of peak oil emissions.</p>
        
        <p>One idea for moving fast is <strong>carbon offsets</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>The purpose of a carbon offset is to offset/counteract/nullify a previous carbon emission — in effect, returning atmospheric carbon levels to a point before your emission took place, such that for the purposes of counting carbon in the atmosphere, your original emission never took place.</p>
        
        <p>This leaves us only with an opportunity cost, of the time and energy spent in going out to fetch your emission, instead of you just not emitting in the first place.</p>
        
        <p>To emphasize: It's way simpler for you, and way better for your future (and everyone else's), to just stop emitting in the first place.</p>
        
        <p>Invest your R&D into ending your emissions before they happen, not running around with a butterfly catcher trying to fetch them back later.  (And if you eliminate your emissions, you don't have to buy any more carbon offsets, because you have no more emissions to offset!)</p>
        
        <p>Maybe enough people reading this will actually start the wheels of industry turning in that direction.  If you do, congratulations!  You've made the rest of this article irrelevant, and I hope that becomes the case.</p>
        
        <p>In the case that carbon offsets remain a thing, well, as the title says:</p>
            
        <h4>If we're going to count, count.</h4>
        
        <p>As you know, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere — only for it to return to the atmosphere — doesn't accomplish anything.</p>
            
        <p>It's like digging a hole in a circle, where every shovelfull ahead of you refills the hole behind you — except, perhaps, you get incrementally better at your technique for temporary displacement.</p>
        
        <p>A pure waste of time, energy, and resources.</p>
        
        <p>So consider this real-world (and ever more common) scenario:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Five years ago, you emitted 100 tons of GHG.</li>
            <li>Instead of reducing your emissions in the first place, you decided to plant 150 of acres of trees, to fetch your emissions after the fact.</li>
            <li>Congratulations!  As of yesterday, the trees you planted removed 100 tons of carbon from the atmosphere.  You have reduced atmospheric carbon levels enough to offset your original 100 tons of emissions — and it only took planting 100,000 trees.</li>
            <li>Now, it's like those 100 tons were never even emitted, leaving us with nothing in the air but the opportunity cost of running around with a butterfly catcher for 5 years, instead of just addressing the problem at the source.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>After all of that ...</p>
        
        <p>Today, you wake up to all 100,000 of your trees burning up in a forest fire, releasing all 100 tons of carbon back into the atmosphere.</p>
        
        <p>Now, it’s like those 100 tons were never even <em>removed</em> in the first place (and you just spent 5 years running around with a butterfly catcher.)</p>
        
        <!-- Five years ago, you emitted 100 tons of GHG.
        - You plant enough trees to pull 100 tons of GHG out of the atmosphere by yesterday.
        - Yay!  You have reduced atmospheric GHG levels enough to offset your original 100 tons of emissions.  Now, it’s like those 100 tons were never even emitted, leaving us with nothing in the air but the opportunity cost of running around with a butterfly catcher for 5 years.
        
        Then, this morning, all of your trees burned down in a wildfire, releasing 100 tons of GHG back into the atmosphere.
        
        <p>Now, it’s like those 100 tons were never pulled out of the atmosphere (and you wasted 5 years of time, energy, and resources).</p> -->
        
        <p>Question:</p>
        
        <strong>Are your 100 emissions still offset?</strong>
        
        <p><em>In reality?</em>  Obviously not.  Those emissions are still in the atmosphere.</p>
        
        <p><em>In the world of carbon offsets?</em></p>
        
        <p>Why is that a seperate question?</p>
            
        <p>Why is the world of carbon offsets different from reality?</p>
        
        <!-- <p>In part, because the people who make "carbon offsets" into things that polluters can buy for money, tend to think of carbon pulled out of the atmosphere as a "credit."  (As in, "carbon credits.")</p> -->
        
        <p>Because the people and organizations and regulators who make "carbon offsets" into things that polluters can buy, tend to regard carbon pulled out of the atmosphere as a "credit."  (As in, <em>"carbon credits".</em>)</p>
        
        <p>This worldview considers removed carbon <strong>credited</strong> on arrival.  Debt paid.  A sum received.
        
        <p>Once the carbon has been pulled from the atmosphere, the polluter's initial emission is offset.  There is nothing more to do.  It is as though the original emission never took place.</p>
        
            <p>This perspective contains an obvious error:</p>
                
                <p>Carbon removed can return to the atmosphere, such that the original <em>removal</em> never took place, and we are back to square one with the original emission.</p>
        
            <p>The idea of removed carbon as "credits" is a fundamental error, and as a result, the systems built on it are broken on first principles.</p>
        
        <p>Crediting removed carbon on arrival — and ignoring the long-term outcome of that removed carbon — literally incentivizes removal <em>without permanence</em>.</p>
        
        <p>Since permanent removal is more difficult to achieve, less permanent offsets are cheaper to produce and sell.</p>
        
        <p>Since impermanent removal is cheaper, impermanent removal is incentivized.</p>
            
        <p>Since impermanent removal is incentivized, impermanent removal is a likely outcome.</p>
            
        <p>And impermanent removal leads us back to ...</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        
            <p>1. Excessive absorption of CO2 is killing ocean life (by reducing PH levels and making the water acidic).</p>

        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Let's revisit an important question:</p>
        
        <h4>What are we trying to do?</h4>
        
        <p>Avoid environment collapse, and improve social outcomes, by lessening burdens, and increasing the environment's carrying capacity.</p>
        
        <p>Today's carbon offset systems don't necessarily contribute to any of those outcomes.</p>
        
        <p>Today's carbon offset systems generate credits, which don't necessarily accomplish anything — and in some cases, worse than nothing, they can actually help firms delay <em>reducing emissions.</em></p>
        
        <p>So if we resist the path of least resistance and decide, instead of stopping emissions before they occur, to try running around with a butterfly catcher for the next 30 years — how can we ensure that our carbon offset systems actually support <strong>what we're trying to do?</strong></p>
        
        <p>Count.</p>
        
        <p>It's that simple.</p>
        
        <p>When a company buys a carbon offset from a carbon removal project, and the project successfully removes carbon, that removed carbon is not "credited" or "recieved" or past-tense at all.</p>
        
        <p>That removed carbon is a dynamic, freeflowing chemical compound, which can return to the atmosphere at any time.</p>
        
        <p>And obviously, if removed carbon returns to the atmosphere, it is no longer <em>removed</em> carbon — so it no longer counts as removed carbon if words have any meaning, and if it's no longer removed carbon, it no longer offsets any prior emissions.</p>
            
            <!-- which is counted <em>in the moment</em> for how much carbon it actually contains, at any given time.</p> -->
        
        <!-- diagram of the vertical bar graph stack, and the horizontal line graph where they fill the curve (going above the curve or under the curve) -->
        
        <!-- <p>If a carbon offset burns up in a pile of smoke, or was nothing more than smoke to begin with, it is counted as such.</p> -->
        
        <p>So if an entity had purchased that no-longer-removed carbon, the no-longer-removed carbon would no longer offset any of the entity's past emissions.</p>
        
        <p>When carbon buyers know that removed carbon will be <em>counted</em> in the long-term (instead of "credited" on arrival), that will create <em>accountability</em> in the system.</p>
        
        <p>Accountability could lead to a variety of new behaviors, generally aligned with the goal of <strong>long-term carbon removal:</strong></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Since permanent carbon removal projects are the least risky (the most likely to be counted as removed carbon, for the longest period of time), they will have the highest demand, and fetch the highest values in the market.</p></li>
            <li><p>It could be so expensive, that many companies could likely choose to swallow the medicine of a better future — and actually invest in stopping their emissions at the source!</p>
            <p>^ This is exactly what we want carbon offsets to do!</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>And if companies decide to buy cheaper carbon removal from impermanent projects, they will do so knowing their investment is ... impermanent.  Risky.</p></li>
            <li><p>Perhaps it could make them "net-zero" for a few years.  But once that removed carbon goes back into the atmosphere, those companies know it will be <strong>counted</strong> as such.  Thus, they know they will be <strong>accountable</strong> for that outcome — and they know they'll have to remove more carbon in a few year's time.</p></li>

        <p>By <strong>counting</strong> carbon, we can even arrive at a more legitimate role for <em>impermanent</em> carbon removal.</p>
            
        <p>Some carbon buyers could choose to invest in short-term, impermanent carbon removal — with the idea that it could <em>buy them time</em> until more permanent carbon removal is more available and less costly.</p>
        
        <p>There is no illusion.  These buyers know they will have to buy more carbon down the road.  But, perhaps in the meantime, they can invest further into eliminating their own emissions.</p>
        
        <p>So even though they'd have to buy more carbon once the impermanent carbon releases back into the atmosphere, they will have fewer emissions to emit in the long-term.</p>
        
        <p>Exactly what we're aiming for.</p>
        
        <p>This is only a strategy with the possibility of integrity — and not an outright gimmick/scam — if the carbon is <strong>counted</strong>, so buyers are <strong>accountable.</strong></p>
        
        <!-- <p>This is only a strategy with the possibility of integrity, and not an outright gimmick/scam, if <em>the carbon is actually counted.</em></p> -->
        
        <p>(Kudos to <a href="https://www.keikicapital.com/bio">Dan Lichtenberg</a> for pointing out this possibility.)</p>
        
        <!-- <p>(Credit to Dan Licthenberg, for pointing out a not-so-cynical strategy here. Some companies could, with integrity, invest in short-term carbon removal — with the idea that, it would buy time until more permanent carbon removal is more powerful and more available.  This seems reasonable.  And yet, this is only a strategy with integrity — not a gimmick — if you actually <strong>count the carbon</strong>.)</p> -->
        
        <!-- <p>Who would benefit from counting carbon?</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The environment.</li>
            <li>Everybody who breathes air, today and in the future.</li>
            <li>Permanent carbon removal projects, which become more valuable in a system that actually counts.</li>
            <li>Impermanent carbon removal projects, who now have a legitimate role in the system (and sleep well at night).</li>
            <li>Politicians and regulators, who can feel proud for changing history for the better.</li>
            <li>Carbon verifiers and standards, who would have a more interesting — and more impactful — job to do.</li>
            <li>Companies, who are forced to take responsibility and actually confront emissions issues – which could significantly improve their future successes.</li>
            <li>CEOs and shareholders, who (I think) breathe air too.</li>
        </ul> -->
        
        <p>So, thanks for reading, that's everything.</p>
        
        <p>If we want to see if carbon offsets actually work — if you want to even seem them do what they were <em>designed for</em> — we need to count removed carbon, in real-time, on a continuously updated basis.</p>

        About the Author

I’m diligently working on the most important problems I can, to create better environmental and social outcomes.  That’s why I wrote this on a Sunday morning, and spent yesterday working on coordination tools for community regeneration, gauze pads for natural systems, and user-owned cooperatives for services and daily infrastructure.  Often, this doesn’t align with “making a living”, because that’s not the point.  So if you want to support my work and help me focus on what’s important, that support would be much appreciated.  Possibly, it could make a big difference — for your life and others, today and in the future.  (Proceeds will generally go towards student loan payments, laptop electricity, and vegetarian brain food 🧠 💪🏽 — blueberries, usually!)

Ways to contribute:

* Pay it forward through service to others
* Recommend me for fellowships, residences, and organizations where I can pursue my work
* Involve my work in grant projects and commercial opportunities
* Hire me/contract me for important work and important projects

I can afford to make these choices because of a lot of privilege and abundance in my life.  If you have been afforded similar opportunities — you have adequate savings, a few years of runway, no urgent need to make more money or put more food on the table — consider doing the same.  Civilization could use more people working with service in mind.  It’s not just about *finding a job* in a more productive industry.  It’s not about the status quo of *having a job.* It’s about thinking from first principles, understanding how life could be a bit better and how you could contribute to that, and actually doing it.  If that aligns with consistent employment and paychecks, that will be comfortable.  If it doesn’t — well, sometimes, doing what’s uncomfortable is what’s best for us.
