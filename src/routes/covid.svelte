Thinking about how to communicate covid.

When you get COVID, you don't get sick because of the virus — you get sick because your body over-reacts to seeing the virus for the first time, and sends your immune system into over-drive.

That infection doesn't give you immunity — it just means that your body has seen the virus before.  That's why the next infection feels milder: because your body's own immune reaction is less intense.

This has nothing to do with what the virus is doing inside your body.

What the virus *is* doing, is:

* Attacking your brain cells, leading to conditions similar to early on-set Alzheimers

* Attacking your veins and vascular systems, leading heart and cardiovascular conditions

* Attacking the weakest organs in your body

* Attacking your body's immune system, making you more suscpetible to every other condition, including future COVID infections and cancer risks (by interfering with your gene that's responsible for stopping cancer)

Getting infected does not make you safer.  It means your body is less likely to *react* to the virus, while the virus stays in your body and continues attacking it long-term.  There is no immunity.  (How many times have you gotten the cold — another coronavirus?  Have you ever gotten immune to the cold?)

There is only avoiding infection, as best as we can.

What does this mean?

Bringing back masks in work, school, and social settings.  Avoiding indoor gatherings.  Air circulation, by opening windows and air filters.  Expanding PCR testing (because at-home over-the-counter tests are often failing to catch new strains.)  Doing more things outside — on walks, in parks, in yards (even in the winter), as our ancestors have done for all of time.  Avoiding infection, as best as we can.  This is all compatible with a free, dynamic, and thriving society – as Taiwan is showing, with some of the lowest cases in the world.

Otherwise, this is the future that some people are counting on:












* Staying in your bone marrow and interfering with your T-Cells, making you more susceptible

That has nothing to do with the virus itself, or what the virus is doing inside your body.

What the virus is doing, is:

* Attacking your brain cells, and interfering with their ability to regenerate, leading to symptoms similar to Alzheimers

* Attacking your veins and vascular system, leading to increased heart rates, heart conditions, and many other cardiovascular problems

* Attacking your body's immune system, making you more suscpetible to everything else, including future COVID infections

* Interfering with your body's T-cell produc

That has nothing to do with


of your immune system going into over-drive, and over-reacting to seeing the virus.

That infection doesn't give you or build your immunity — it just means that your body has seen the virus before, so the next it gets the infection, your body's own immune response won't be as intense.



Getting infected doesn't give you immunity — it just means that your body has seen the response for the first time, so your bod

When you get milder infections later

you get sick because the body's overactive immune response.
