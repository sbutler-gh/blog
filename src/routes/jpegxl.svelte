Has there been any though to making a Chromium fork (or another browser fork) that is compatible with JPEG XL? @jxl

It could also open a door to some other interesting browser tweaks (e.g. LibRedirect https://github.com/libredirect by default, HTMX https://htmx.org/ compatibility?)  And yet, at it's simplest, it could start with a simple browser fork that is compatible with JPEG XL?
