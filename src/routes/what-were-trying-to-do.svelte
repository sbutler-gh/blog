The challenge is, we want something in the conversation, in the mainstream.  But we want many stories, many voices, many mediums, a plurality, a diversity.  A TV show comes to mind, because it seems like it can hold mainstream attention the best nowadays.  (Maybe a song).  But in either case, it's a fraction of a population, and what we're looking for, is awareness and reflection in many populations.

We want lots of populations, communities, worlds, to be talking and thinking and exploring about the crises facing us and what we can do today, to give to our descendants and give to ourselves in this moment.  Crises of neoliberalism, climate collapse, displacement, extraction, genocide, colonialism, capitalism, racism.  Crises of decayed communities, isolation, unhealth and unwellness, lack of culture and direction, consumption, lack of purpose and meaning, lack of relations and conviviality and eutrapelia.

What we can do, in terms of what we have around us -- what will not exacerbate the problems or are derivative of the problems (e.g. electric cars), but what we can do that reflects an awareness and grasp of the problems we're chest deep in (ignorance of our extraction and externalities, ignorance of how to make, the commodification of everything, everything being turned into money), and doing our daily practice and making our new worlds *while looking*, as the Zapatistas might say.  Learning from the past which shaped our present (which we must never forget, for wisdom is learning from the mistakes of ours and others' pasts), and learning in consultation with those yet to come -- recognizing, that as the present is formed from the past, tomorrow is formed from today, and those yet to come are here with us in this moment now as well.

This is the what.  This is the themes.  The boundaries.  The spirit.  The directions.  In practice, what could it look like?  Many things.  To open the perspective of possibilities with examples (without suggesting that these *are* the examples), consider:

- A digital series, with episodes comprised of short stories, appearing on different streaming platforms (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, others) at the same time -- and on each different streaming platform, the episodes are different versions of each other, made by different producers.  Many different stories, many different voices, many different worlds -- even when stories may be the same.  The purpose of multiple platforms is to bring something into the conversation in many worlds, while doing so in alignment with the themes and the worlds we're trying to create.  And in mainstream Global North zeitgeist, the conversation would not be "did you see that new show on Netflix?" -- but rather, "have you seen the show, that's appearing in different versions across different streaming platforms?"  That feels like something that could generate conversation and reflection and engagement in the moment were in, that is aligned with the worlds we're trying to create.
