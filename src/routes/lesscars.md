An underwater forest.

Colors glow in the dark blue depths.  Purple, bright green, translucent blue skins.

The water breaths, gently pulsing.  A soft breeze, and underwater current, rolls through — swaying the neon plants and corals, gently pulling clear squids and color-changing octopi and magical green creatures into the current.

Clear.  Quiet.  Wild.  Alive.

A glimpse of the planet we belong to, how things may have once been … or how they are yet to be.

As a sea vent releases gases, we feel and hear a muted vibration.  Breathing?  Pulsing?  Or …?

The vibration loudens.  Our underwater kin, the mobile ones at least, slip back in alert — the octopus camouflages itself.

And the sound gets LOUD.  The beings of this place dart away, out of view, abandoning the algae forests and coral reefs — leaving it still, empty, part, as the sound almost gets too loud.

A MACHINE, yellow and boxlike with a wide plow up front, motors into view — plowing up rocks from the ocean floor, kicking up clouds of dirt, and in the process, scraping or trampling all of the plants that couldn’t flee fast enough, who made their last stand, of a place lost forever.  (A place, being a space with beings and culture embedded in it — more than a space alone.  If you want an example of space without place, look at mowed grass lawn at every yard in the “developed” world.)

CUT TO:

An animated rendering of a yellow excaver on empty ocean space, silently and harmlessly rolling on its treads and collecting rocks, and pleasantly feeding those rocks up to the surface.  It’s playing on a screen — a video conference call.  A product presentation.  To a dozen small faces and camera-off squares in the window.

“With this technology, we can harvest enough resources for one hundred thousand new electric vehicles — ethically sourced, without any violence, land violations, mines, or expensive negotiations.  All we need, is for the UN and the authoring body, to agree — and we can begin harvesting within the month.”

— “I don’t understand.”

In the middle of a HIGHWAY, a driver leans out of their window, and speaks with a teenager standing on the highway — in between lanes of a traffic jam.

“To make cars, it takes metal.  Companies get the metal,” the teenager continues, “from rainforests, from mountains, from underwater forests — places that have more magic, more mysteries, than the planets in our solar system.  So you want electric cars and mines all over the planet?  Or do you want ways to get around without a car, without —“ the teenager gestures to the traffic jam — “*this*, and keep our home too?

“You probably don’t even need a car anyway,” the teenager continues.  “The stress, the back problems from this stuff — my mom was a driver, I know.”

The driver sits up and twists their arm behind their back, rubbing their lower back between the seat.

“So, would you mind sharing your choice?”

The teenager extends a paper on a clipboard, with two checkboxes.

Cars and Mines        Less Cars, More World
    [ ]                      [ ]

The checkboxes rise off the clipboard, turning digital, on the screen in front of us.  A choice for us.  Interactive.

Cars and Mines        Less Cars, More World
    [ ]                      [ ]

[IF audience chooses Cars and Mines]

The scene continues, and we see the clipboard.

Cars and Mines        Less Cars, More World
    [X]                      [ ]

The teenager shakes their head into the camera.  “Good luck.”

BACK TO CHOOSE AGAIN <— this takes us back to the interactive choice.

[IF audience chooses Less Cars, More world]

The scene continues, and we see the clipboard.

Cars and Mines        Less Cars, More World
     []                      [x]

“Why are you doing this?” the driver asks, handing the pen back to the teenager.

“The UN is deciding on this right now — we’re showing them what life on Earth is for.

“Speaking of, would it be cool if I take a picture, to include with your response?”

The teenager holds up their smartphone for a pic.
