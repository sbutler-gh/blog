In a grey room, a group of men who grew up during Watergate sit around a table scattered with papers.

A younger man, almost with a squeak in his voice (born after you could find porn on the Internet — “didn’t even have to work for it!”) stands beside a whiteboard and reads off names.

We can see the names in UPPERCASE, along with salary numbers in the millions and STATS and NUMBERS beside them.

YOUNG MAN
Scott.  Harper.  Angelo.  Carr.

One of the men at the table, BILLY, compares his notes to the names on the whiteboard.

BILLY
Where’s Oscar?

Frustrations rise, they’ve been through this before —

ANOTHER MAN
(annoyed)
He’s retired, Billy!

BILLY
(sharp look)
He *ain’t* retired.

A third man SLAPS the table.

THIRD MAN
(yelling)
*He’s not fucking flying!* —

We cut to a press conference, where an All-Star player in his early-30s sits alone behind the table, leaning into a microphone mid-sentence.  This is OSCAR HART.

OSCAR
— planes.

Confused murmurs in the press pit, camera bulbs flash, pens scribble on pads, reporters shouting for questions without a moment’s thought.  Oscar, prepared and understanding, looks into it directly.  He points to a reporter begging for a word, begging to ask the question he already knows.

REPORTER
Does that mean you’re done playing?

OSCAR
(calming the situation, reassuring)
I’ll be here for the home games.  And the ones across the river.  Can bus or train almost anywhere in a day, so I’ll be at plenty of road games too —

Another reporter CALLS OUT.

REPORTER 2
Just in your career, or your personal life too?

OSCAR
(chuckles)
What do you think?

— Interrupting the moment, another reporter speaks up.

REPORTER 3
Do you think other players will follow your lead, and stop flying too?

OSCAR
I hope so.  They might actually have time with their kids again.

Reporters scribble the response.

REPORTER 4
Then what would happen to the sport?  How would it work, if none of the players or teams fly around?

Oscar considers his response.

OSCAR
Adapt, like the rest of the world is doing.

Sensing a moment, Oscar continues.

OSCAR
… Would you all do it with me?

The press pit goes quiet.

OSCAR
Y’all know I can give you plenty of stories to cover around here.

Smiles and laughs break the tension — Oscar laughs at himself with them.  Reminiscing over all his headlines over the years.  And the reporters think about his offer, to their credit.

OSCAR
… So, what do you all say?
(beat)
… Drinks on me downtown tonight?
